hello

this is a VERY small program (its not even good)

# how to run it?

make sure you have python 3.10.4 or higher installed

then run the program or type:

    python3 main.py

in the terminal, make sure your in the directory where the program is located (src/main.py)

im sure you can figure out how to use it
